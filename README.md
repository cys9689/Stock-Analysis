# Stock Analysis 
## Language Usage: VBA
This project is a VBA practice. The AllStock Analysis sheet is a template that is capable of calculating the yearly return for stock in 2017 or 2018.
The Refactor sheet optimize the template code. Instead of loop through all the stock data for each ticker we analyzed, the refactor code loop through the data only once and collect all of the information it needs in a single pass.
